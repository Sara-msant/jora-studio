    "description": "Located in the heart of Olhão’s historic center, this renovation project reimagines a traditional building into two independent contemporary homes.\n\nThe original structure was completely redesigned to enhance spatial flow, comfort, and light.\nA new roof level was added to accommodate an additional bedroom, extending the living space vertically while preserving the building’s authentic character.\n\nEach residence spans approximately 120 square meters and features two bedrooms, one bathroom, a guest WC, a kitchen, dining area, and a terrace on the upper floor — creating a dialogue between heritage and modern living.\n\nThrough thoughtful spatial planning and material refinement, the project celebrates the charm of Olhão’s old town while offering a renewed sense of contemporary elegance.",
